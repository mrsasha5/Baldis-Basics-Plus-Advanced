# Dependencies
**BepInEx, Baldi's Basics Plus DEV API and Level Loading System are main dependencies of the mod.**<br>
*This modification also includes another dependencies.*

## The public code includes only the necessary mods in its dependencies.<br>
### Please note that the public source code does not include the game's dependencies and the game's DLL which contains Plus code.<br>
You will need to extract these files from BALDI_Data/Managed folder.<br>
You should also take into account that the dependent DLLs must match the version of the game on which this version of the mod was released, since the game and other mods are updated during versions and a lot of code becomes outdated, which makes the mod impossible to build.
